# Project Structure:

## 'internal' directory
includes internal packages of project

### 'protcol' package:  
Outlines the way data is sent and processed
- thinking of having distinct delimiters or indicators for
processing
- an interface 'command' that lets me call run or a translate
function from any point in project
